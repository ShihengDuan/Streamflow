# Streamflow
streamflow projection
Essential code and notebooks for Using Temporal Convolution Neural Network for Streamflow Projection for California. 

Keras and Tensorflow is used for this project. 

Code:

Ensemble for ensemble run with different random initial weights.  
Metrics for comprehensive comparison.   
Ideal test is for extreme forcing test.   
Projection contains code for future projection analysis.
