# Streamflow
streamflow projection
Essential code and notebooks for Using Temporal Convolution Neural Network for Streamflow Projection for California. 

Keras and Tensorflow is used for this project. 

Code:
Ensemble for ensemble run with different random initial weights. Metrics for comprehensive comparison. Ideal test is for extreme forcing test. Projection contains code for future projection analysis.
